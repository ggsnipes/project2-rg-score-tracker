# Music Game Score Tracker

Quick summary of this is that it will track scores from a person and show their best score on each song

- Have to find a way to keep only the best score on each track
- Find a way to list all the songs without needing to manually put them into a database
- Have to learn how to show multiple scores instead of a single person's score.
- Issues with how max score is set, unable to set a dynamic limit.

## Wireframe

This is what the wireframe for this project seemed to look like, mainly had issues trying to get the scores to show properly for other players.
