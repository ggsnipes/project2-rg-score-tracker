# Music Game Score Tracker

Quick summary of this is that it will track scores from a person and show their best score on each song

- Have to find a way to keep only the best score on each track
- Find a way to list all the songs without needing too much work
- Also need to learn how to read scores from a person's input either manually or importing a database/csv file.

## TODO

- have a functional website that can use for signing in and testing out that the app works
- make something to work by the end of tonight.
